# Hackintosh for HP 340 G4
 
The Main Boot way is OpenCore,while the clover is also perfect.

All works Well including Hibernate (S4 Sleep)

I had change the Wifi Card 7260AC to Apple origin wifi card,so you should deal youself.

For more, my bios version is F30,wihch can unlock advance setting in bios through press A and F10,this can deal with some problems,such as dvmt, cfg lock, kenellapic, etc... All of these can improve your experience,although can solve by Bootloader.
BY the way,the only way to downgrade bios version is to use SPI FLASH Compiler.
